# Breast-cancer-classification-with-simple-Neural-Network-NN-
This project aims to develop a simple neural network model for classifying breast cancer tumors as either malignant or benign based on features extracted from digitized images of breast tissue. Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers among women globally, and early detection plays a crucial role in improving patient outcomes. By leveraging machine learning techniques, particularly neural networks, we can create a predictive model that aids in the early diagnosis of breast cancer
